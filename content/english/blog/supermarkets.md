If we asked what the biggest supermarket pain point was for store owners, what do you think the answer would be? Getting more customers through the door perhaps? Upselling to them when they get there? Providing information about limited stock items and sales? Or maybe it would be improving things internally - making staff communications easier and improving productivity. What if we told you there was a simple solution that solved, say 10 different problems using one system? Sure, it might be hard to believe, but the truth is, we’ve seen it in action.

Enter digital signage.

Digital signage (that’s the art of using TV screens to share content) is so much bigger than entertainment alone. It’s a seriously useful way of managing promotions as well as staff and customer journeys through to that all important sale. The supermarket chains have already begun to transform how their customers buy helped by digital signage. Communication strategy contributes to the achievement of corporate goals, improves the brand image, allows to differentiate from competitors, creates a community around the company and commits customers.

NeoSlide allows you to promote offers and characteristics of products in a simple way and with a great impact on the consumer, with the advantage that it does not require logistics costs such as distribution, materials or printing. Digital signage offers countless solutions. In a industry with thousands of references, such as supermarkets, this is a great advantage over traditional solutions. Digital signage enables to display all kinds of offers, prices and promotions on one screen, helping to increase sales and improve the customer’s buying experience.

Due to the easy updating and content programming offered by NeoSlide, it is possible to simultaneously display different ads at different points in the supermarket, depending on the characteristics of each of those points. Messages in formats like graphics, images, videos, moving text etc. can be switched easily and programmed into playlists with a centralized management point, everything in real time. 

Customers now expect a more engaging and immersive experience. According to a Cisco IBSG study, over 40% of shoppers say that digital displays can change what they buy. Placing a display along the top of the fridge provides prime real estate for vendors to bring their brands to life, capture the attention of customers, boost impulse purchases and drive greater revenue. Also you can install tablets on every aisle and using NeoSlide ypu can display specific information regarding the products on the aisle.
