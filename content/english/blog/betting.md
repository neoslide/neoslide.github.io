Casinos advertise the kinds of glamorous experiences consumers can’t find anywhere else, so guests are naturally going to make that glamour the very first thing they confirm. To support this luxurious reputation casinos must keep pace with changing trends in interior design, architecture, entertainment, and gaming.
