   Digital signage in banks, insurance and law firms is starting to resemble the pattern of behavior seen in retail digital signage. Although still a primary focus, efficiency and product provision is slowly joined by the focus on enhancing the client experience. This includes the use of features such as entertainment, education and cross-selling, all of which we'll examine below.

## Minimize the complexity of information

   NeoSlide Digital signage can serve as a platform for a series of presentations or videos to elaborate information to the customer, both of which have powerful advantages. Instead of having a staff member explain general data, a display can show a presentation of financial reports, changes or updates which the customer may find useful. The main difference between a digital display and a standard statistical chart or map in a bank is that the display can elaborate a much broader array of data in less time and confusion. In the world of finance, the amount of material you can display is virtually endless, making it a great combination with digital signage.

## Ease of access and the customer experience

   With a digital system of any kind, interactive or otherwise, the customer experience is immediately enhanced. However, it's important to point out that the efficiency and client management is mainly improved with interactivity. Banks, and other establishments where line formations are a daily sight, can use interactive displays to help clients reach their objective easier. If there is a variety of locations in the structure, the display can readily instruct the clients. For instance, if a client wants to discuss a loan or a more serious financial matter, they can register for a private session and be directed to the appropriate line or location. Otherwise, a client unfamiliar with the structure would have to wait in line only to ask for directions.

   A quickly growing branch, retail-like focus of digital signage can be seen in other industries as well, including healthcare, manufacturing and hospitality, further confirming the fact that 2020 is becoming the year of digital signage and displays.

## Lower perceived wait times

   Not the only common feature of digital signage in this article, shorter time perception applies to any industry which has waiting time involved. Boredom is the target of this feature, and it's successfully eliminated by the use of digital signage. This is not limited to entertainment alone as you can use digital signage to display offers to your clients. Weather, local events, results or other interesting data can be displayed as well. Some institutions have a separate corner for parents with children. Amongst toys and other components, cartoons can be an interesting choice as well. Displaying exchange rates is without a doubt the most common information found on a bank wall. A digital display used for this purpose ensures an easy update option. It can even provide up-to-minute information if you connect it to an online source.

## Promote products and services to waiting customers

   Promoting something to the customer goes hand in hand with the previous matter we just saw. New offers and advantages of these offers can be explained on a digital display. Presenters and persuasion attempts from staff members have become a case which we all try to instinctively evade. With a display, it might just prove more efficient as it doesn't intimidate the customer when he declines the offer and provides them with the data. Many banks, for instance, have apps or websites available for their clients, which is an interesting concept to consider. As they wait in line, customers can be informed on how to download and install the app or navigate the website.

   New credit cards, packages or deals unique to your own institution can be easily presented and elaborated. Add to that the increased efficiency and promotion amount and you have a great advantage on your hands.

   Cross-selling involves selling new products or services to an existing customer, which increases their loyalty and lowers the chance of them to move to a different provider. Listing all features is an option, but you can also target a specific audience by displaying certain offers fitting to the specific time of day. For instance, when there's an activity like cashing checks or making deposits at a particular time of the day, you can advertise complementary or additional offers.

## Provide your clients with vital information

   Education is a great content choice for this platform, especially in an institution where your clients tend to seek for more than simple money withdrawals and deposits. In other financial establishments like financial law firms or insurance companies, your clients will benefit from as much knowledge and information they can acquire.

   Share legal information with your clients via displays in the lobby. This can also include general data they can use inside and outside their case. You can remind your clients about matters which could hurt their case, such as giving recorded statements or speaking directly to insurance companies.

   Graphic content, videos and statistical records can all be displayed to your clients. Whilst factors such as entertainment, cross-selling and efficiency are all important, people hardly go to a law firm on a daily basis. This is why entertainment is typically the primary focus.

   In addition, efficiency is the primary focus of digital signage, and it can greatly benefit from its mere presence. Much like in the human hierarchy, it can also impact the corporate hierarchy of needs. You can check out the full article on this hierarchy and see the business stages from a different perspective.

## Tablet interactivity in finance

   Whilst presenting various data on your digital screens can be beneficial, interactive tablets can allow the users to seek out specific information they'd like to see. This can enhance the customer experience and help clients examine your products and services in a more fun and interesting way.

## Digital signage in finance summarized

Entertainment falls under the customer experience as it can help lower perceived waiting times for customers.
