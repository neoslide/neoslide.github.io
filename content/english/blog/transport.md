   Keeping your customers up to speed with the latest information relevant to them to make their journey and travel experience a good one – ideally so that they return – is crucial. Travelling is a matter of getting people places as fast and efficiently as possible but the whole experience should include so much more.

   Digital signage is emerging as a way of enhancing that travel experience from a customer point of view, while also making the process easier for transport employees. It is even possible to shrink perceived waiting times down with the use of digital signage.

   Digital signage is a common sight in airport waiting areas, train stations, bus shelters and other transportation venues. Strategically-located displays enable your transit signage system so it can inform and entertain viewers, minimize wait times, enhance the travel experience and at the end, increase your income by renting your displays as an advertising space for your clients.

   NeoSlide digital signage software platform enhances the passenger’s experience for any type of travel enable digital displays installed in airports, bus shelters and railway stations to guide passengers and commuters more efficiently. 

   The first thing for anyone visiting an airport or railway station needs to see is clear signage of where to go. Multiply that by hundreds if not thousands of individuals coming through the doors and those screens employed for this type of information can be an amazing investment in comparison to the bulky large banners and stand up signs. You can add maps of the station so you can help travellers find their way easily at your terminal, display different kind of promotions, nearby restaurants and atractions, post offices, shops and boutiques and everything that is connected with your terminal. In your waiting room you can also display informational videos about history of your city, culture and traditions, tourist attractions, interesting facts, quizes etc thus shortening the perception of the waiting time of everyone who is waiting for his transport.

   But the biggest advantage of NeoSlide digital signage system is displaying arrivals and departures informations that every travellers looks for. NeoSlide has already made integration with airport arrivals/departures web services, but of course is open for integration with additional web services, based on your needs.

   Also, you can display weather forecast on your terminal for number of cities, so all the travelles know how will be the weather in the next couple of days. NeoSlide has also implement air quality information, that also can be quite interesting for everyone that passes by.

   Dynamic messaging on screens is aesthetically pleasing for travellers, but it serves a more important purpose of conveying updated train, flight and airport information to them, which is critical in fast-paced airport and train stations. For airport authorities, digital signage can make for a safer and more secure environment, as well as aid the constant flow of traffic in the terminals.
