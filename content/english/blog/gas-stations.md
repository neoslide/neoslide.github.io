   When talking about the company's approach to innovation it's all about ensuring seamless connectivity between key systems, processes, operational workflows and customer touchpoints.

   Gas stations have a multitude of customer touchpoints available to create a seamless digital experience. From the forecourt and entrance to in-store point of sale advertising screens. Focusing on delivering the right content at every touchpoint in the journey can not only improve the customer experience, but also the effectiveness of promotions. Due to the flexible nature of NeoSlide digital signage, promotions can be created, tested and tailored quickly, giving your company an advantage over less nimble competitors.

   Now let's talk about the different options.

   Whether it be integrated within the pump or directly facing customers as they drive up, a digital display within the forecourt is a strategic opportunity to upsell and cross sell products and services. While the dwell time may be short, the ability to provide impactful messages is incentive enough for a digital display. Brands and vendors are constantly looking for new ways to market themselves and forecourt signage is the perfect opportunity to reach customers directly at the first touch point.
With NeoSlide, beside traditional way of displating advertisments, you can also enable the Moving Text function that enables you to add moving text in the bottom of the screen displaying information about petrol prices or maybe the working time of the petrol station.

   NeoSlide also gives you the opportunity to impress customers as they walk through the door with a large-scale LED video wall. Installing a shop entrance digital sign allows petrol station operators to customize content based on the location of the petrol station. Display your most important products right on the entrance and enable them to be the first thing your customers see when entering your facility.

   Customers now expect a more engaging and immersive experience. According to a Cisco IBSG study, over 40% of shoppers say that digital displays can change what they buy. Placing a display along the top of the fridge provides prime real estate for vendors to bring their brands to life, capture the attention of customers, boost impulse purchases and drive greater revenue. Also you can install tablets on every aisle and using NeoSlide ypu can display specific information regarding the products on the aisle.  

   Do you offer dinning possibilities in your petrol stations? Add display on which your delicious specialties will be displayed or add digital menus to modernize your restaurant and give your customers impression of a hight tech luxurious restaurant.

   A seamless digital experience is the key to long-term success for petrol stations. From the ability to test the effectiveness of promotions instantly through on the fly content updates, to personalizing each customers interaction with targeted and relevant advertisements, innovation is essential for petrol stations to deliver a sustainable boost to their bottom line.
