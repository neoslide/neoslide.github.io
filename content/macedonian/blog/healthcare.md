Healthcare providers constantly deal with important, and often-life-threatening issues. Hospitals and clinics must be accessible and well suited to any visitor or patient, regardless of their age or health. Not surprisingly, these facilities cater to a constant flow of visitors who are often unfamiliar with their surroundings. And to top it offâ€¦ Staff, visitors and patients need to be kept informed, motivated, and entertained throughout the day. Healthcare providers must ensure the health and well-being of everyone. The larger the facility, the more complex the challenge.

Hospital and clinic lobbies benefit from message displays that welcome patients and visitors 24/7. Use NeoSlide to display the most important information about the facility right in your lobby using images, videos, additional information like weather forecast or air quality or simply add your own web services etc. This is one of many opportunities to deliver a better experience.

Displays can also also be used to help people find their way in your facility. For example, redirect people to specific areas, like meeting with a triage specialist in an emergency room or clinic. You can add map of your facility or create a great video animation that will show the way around your hospital.

Depending on the specialty ( surgery, dentistry, eye care, etcâ€¦), digital signage content can be educational in nature. For example, lobby displays can be programmed to show videos that explain medical procedures, healthy eating tips and guidelines, medical innovations, drug information and moreâ€¦ Also, in front of every ordination you can add small tablet displays, where you can show information about the ordination or information about the doctor that is working in it.

Displays installed in common areas can play a mix of empowering, engaging and motivational content while lunch room displays can present daily menus and specials.

There are a lot of ways to improve health care facilities with the benefits of using digital signage system and thus improving patientâ€™s impression about your facility. And NeoSlide can offer all you need.

And much more...
